                <p>Hey there! My name is Arian Sadeghi and I’m a high school senior from Ontario, Canada. I have a broad set of interests ranging from arts and design all the way to fitness and bodybuilding; however, my major interests are in leadership, technology, engineering, and business. Leaders and the role they play in our societies fascinates me, especially those who see things differently and lead major advancements. I really admire visionary leaders such as Elon Musk and am greatly inspired by them: so much so that I’ve set my life goal to be a leader at the forefront of advancing humankind. It is a truly ambitious goal with the bar set really high; regardless, I’m committed, confident in my abilities, and know that together, with other talented people, great things can be accomplished. Currently, I plan to study computer science in university, and most importantly, plan to make connections and work with other great minds to set out on a great endeavour.</p>
